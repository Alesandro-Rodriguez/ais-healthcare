Problem Statemnt consideration:
Given:-During times of natural disasters, how can patient assistance be improved through better organizing available resources from within a larger healthcare company and available emergency preparedness and disaster relief resources?
To provide a starting point, we will be providing a deidentified data set with over 200,000 of our employees. How can this data be used to better prepare our facilities for these devastating storms? 
What other sources of data might be useful?
It will be your job to answer not only these questions, but others that we may not have considered.
